# Nutrition Helper - Group Project 1 

## Description 

Nutrition Helper is an application that allows the user to find foods, various information, and various locations to purchase products based on zip-code submission. We used tailwind for styling the page. We fetched the information for nutrition from the Edamam Food Database API. We fetched the store information from the Bing Maps Locations API.
